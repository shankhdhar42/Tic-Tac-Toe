A "Tic Tac Toe" game project aims to create a digital representation of the classic pencil-and-paper game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 
3x3 grid with their designated symbol (X or O), with the goal to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) 
to win
